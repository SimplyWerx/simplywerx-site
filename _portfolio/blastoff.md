Visitors generate electrical energy for hydrolysis by spinning a handwheel, producing hydrogen and oxygen gases at the precise 2:1 ratio by volume. They can observe the gases being collected, then experience the dramatic moment when a tiny spark ignites the mixture. The recombination releases energy violently, propelling a miniature rocket upwards along its guide line.

Designed for both education and excitement, Blast Off transforms abstract chemistry and physics concepts into a tangible experience. By combining safe experimentation with interactive play, it helps learners understand how energy conversion and chemical reactions power modern rocketry.
