With its elegant visuals and responsive performance, the Compass App quickly became a popular tool for everyday navigation, offering users both reliability and style. By blending technical accuracy with thoughtful user experience, it demonstrates our ability to create mobile applications that are both functional and engaging.

We created two versions of the Compass App, each powered by a different graphics engine under the hood:

* A 2D version leveraging the efficiency of Android’s Canvas system.

Doesn't take up much space on the phone, and only asks for minimal permissions…"
