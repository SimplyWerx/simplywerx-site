We designed and built an **all‑in‑one flight controller** tailored for autonomous and scripted miniature performance drones. The system integrates IMU sensors, an ARM‑based microprocessor, an NRF 2.4GHz radio link, and BLHeli‑based ESCs with MOSFET drivers for brushless motors.

To enable precise indoor navigation, the controller incorporates **Decawave (Qorvo) UWB** chipsets supporting Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) algorithms for positioning. It is engineered to work seamlessly with miniature off‑the‑shelf brushless motors, making it versatile and cost‑efficient for performance applications.

A variation of this controller was deployed in the **Robot Theatre at the Science Centre Singapore**, where it powered a tethered autonomous drone. The drone’s choreography was synchronized with the show, demonstrating the system’s ability to combine **engineering precision with creative performance** in a live interactive environment.
