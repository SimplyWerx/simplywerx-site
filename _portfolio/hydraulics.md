We created a hands‑on STEM exhibit that teaches kids about the power of hydraulics and their role in modern machinery and robotics. Using simple levers, children control a **5‑degree‑of‑freedom robotic arm and grip**, learning how hydraulic systems translate force into motion as they manipulate a ball.

The project involved **designing, CAD modeling, simulations, prototyping, 3D printing, CNC machining, and extensive user testing** to ensure both durability and intuitive operation.

This interactive has been **deployed at the Science Centre Singapore** and as part of a **travelling exhibit** that brings STEM learning directly to schools, inspiring young learners to explore engineering through play and discovery.
